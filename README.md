# Sysdev base app
This app is my personal project, where I used most common React Native use cases, such as Geolocation, Maps, Geocoding, forms, styled components, ImagePicker, Camera, and some Other stuff.

I call it base app, because is where is the code I developed on my own; and where I can search for, if I have some doubts about something.

1.  **Important Information about the project**
- APP developed with React Native

2. **Running the project**
- First of all, clone it with ``` git clone git@github.com:trsp400/sysdev-base-app.git``` (using SSH) or ```git clone https://github.com/trsp400/sysdev-base-app.git``` (using HTTPS).
- After cloning, get into the folder with ```cd sysdev-base-app```
- Inside this folder, there is a *package.json* specifying all the project's information, including the dependencies.
- In the terminal run the command ```npm install``` or ```yarn``` to install all the dependencies.
- Then, just run ```npm run android``` or ```yarn addroid``` to start the development server.
- Sometimes the MetroBundler windows does not open(most common on linux), if this happens, just run ```yarn start``` or ```npm start``` to start metro bundler.
- Now you're finished!
